## Outline

For my final project I intend to investigate income inequality and the role that our financial system plays in helping the ‘haves’ have more, and the ‘have nots’ having much much less.  For the project I intend to combine bold callout statistics of the financial health of the united states and intersperse these with visualizations showing both trends over time as well as creating and visualizing simulations to explain how the monetary system works and how the problem got to be this bad.  

This work is motivated in large part by my time as a financial advisor, while we had many sophisticated tools at our disposal, we lacked a clear and compelling visualization that could explain the foundational concept of interest to our less sophisticated clients.  This project is intended to address that resource gap and provide a high level overview of how interest works both for and against an individual. 

The project will open with a bold callout statistic ‘Over 40% of Americans could not afford an emergency expense of $400’ The reason why is INTERESTing…. The shorthand story would next detail how compound interest can benefit those with the means to save and then pivot to explain how interest continues to keep those in debt mired in debt.  We would pivot back to a macro statistic of total US indebtedness and next explore where debt comes from in the first place using a simulated graphic to explain fractional reserve banking.  Lastly, the story would call with a strong call to action to advocate for legislation to cap interest rates to help give those trapped in debt a path forward to sounder financial footing.

## Data 
A variety of data sources will be used to tell a clear compelling narrative of the current financial conditions in the United States. The government data below will be used for call out statistics higlighting financial limitations and used to create visualization of time series data and inform future trends.   

[Federal Reserve Report on the Economic Well-Being of US Households]( https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/appendix-b-consumer-responses-to-survey-questions.htm)

[NY Fed – Center for Microeconomic Data]( https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/databank.html)

[Survey of Consumer Finances – Federal Reserve]( https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm)

[SIPP – Survey of Income and Program Participation – Census Bureau]( http://thedataweb.rm.census.gov/ftp/sipp_ftp.html)

The visualizations showing macroeconomic trends such as long term interest compounding or money creation will be created in-house using established macroeconomic principals as the underly assumptions.  While these graphs are not built on an underlying dataset, the core assumptions used in creating them will be clearly cited.  

## Method and Medium 
The project will be executed in Shorthand using a linear telescoping approach whereby the reader’s attention is captivated by bold callout statistics (How few consumers can afford an emergency expense, that the average American household has over $100,000 of debt) and then drill down into to deeper explanations and visualizations of what this data means and how it impacts both individuals and the larger macro economy.

The design objective is to use text sparsely and instead use compelling images and visualizations to tell a captivating story that is broken up by bold text callouts. The story will progress by first framing a problem and then exploring the good and bad of interest, and then pivot to a quick history of how we got here and where indebtedness is projected to grow.  The story will end with a firm call to action to advocate for legislation aimed at capping interest as a means of improving financial footing for many Americans.
