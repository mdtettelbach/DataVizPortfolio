## Final Deliverable - [Shorthand link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/mtettelbach/FinalVizProject/)

### Process

This has been an interesting project and an eye-opening look at the full data visualization life cycle.  I began the project wanting to break down a complex topic for a wide audience but was not sure which topic to choose.  In reflecting on my background, I realized my time in finance could make for an interesting project as it’s a topic that is relevant to almost everyone yet something that many individuals do not fully understand.  

Originally, I mocked up a much more academic like sort of talk focused on introducing money and banking to a lay audience.  However, the initial reaction I got to this was a deafening yawn and a so what. From here, I reframed the talk to focus a lot more on social justice and equity and delve into an underexplore facet of income inequality.  

While the details and content evolved following user feedback and testing my visuals, I maintained the same telescoping structure – first framing a macro issue, then delving into micro details and ending with a firm and compelling call to action.  User feedback was instrumental to developing the final work product.  Coming from industry and being a fairly wonky guy I realized that assumptions I took for granted came across as a foreign language to my intended audience. I spent a lot of time paring down my graphs and story lines to only hit the key points while both simplifying the content and cutting out useless chart junk.  

Lastly, I strove to use data to tell a story and put my visuals at the forefront and wove my supporting text around this which I hope led to a stronger final deliverable.  

### Audience

I wanted to make this presentation as accessible to everyone and presumed only an interest in the subject and no formal or pre-existing financial knowledge.  Sadly, in my experience in the industry, it was my most vulnerable and financially insecure clients who could benefit most form this knowledge.  Sadly, they often did not get the information they needed until a serious course correction was needed.  While not impossible to recover, it’s much easier to keep a car on the road than it is to crash down the side of a mountain and try and push the car back to the road…

Seeking user feedback, I first started not with my own ideas but with client tested and approved materials from several large banks and well regarded trade groups.  In my opinion, all the materials had serious shortcomings, but I wanted to see from a lay audience how they’d react and interact with the materials to get the best idea of how to design my own materials. 
In short, I found that less is more, and rather than try and cram six ideas into one visual I’m much better making more simply graphs than one hybrid monstrosity that in trying to display everything effectively displays nothing.  

### Lessons Learned 

Allowing adequate time to test and develop on a new platform, I did the majority of my graphs in Tableau and while they looked great on my worksheet and embedded to Git nicely, they did not render as intended in ShortHand.  I wrongly assumed that I could learn shorthand quickly given the drag and drop interface and didn’t have the time to get the polished look I would have liked.  Building this on a larger screen at home, my graphs looked great, but when testing on campus, graphs were wrapping and getting cut off across pages.  To correct this, I used a split screen template to get the graphs the correct scale.  This resulted in graphs that are on the small side with fairly useless placeholder text. 

I also learned not to force elements into the story that don’t belong, I mocked up eight graphics and only published and used four,  while it can be frustrating to develop content that is not used, I feel that it is much better to develop content that is more consistent and on message than trying to weave in loosely related ideas.
All told it was an interesting project that I got a lot out of.  I will be sure to keep these concepts in mind as I undertake future visualization work.
