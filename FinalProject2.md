Initial mockup was created using open source graphs to seek out user feedback on how individuals respond to current presentations of financial information.

## Part 2  - Storyboard and User Research
### objective
Having drafted the following [outline](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uWK4O_bypTyF-28xvB8eca0YlWpUS2Jg/view?usp=sharing) I knew that I wanted to present a captivating story that probed some of the root causes of income inequality.  While there are a myriad of directions I could have taken this, I opted to focus on compound interest as it’s an easier topic to understand and relatable to anyone who has ever saved or borrowed before.  In addition, there is proposed legislation to cap interest rates that can be tied into a clear call to action.  
### User Research
I took a slightly different approach to this.  Rather than share my own initial sketches, I built a demo deck using existing graphs from leading organizations and experts in the field.  While all the graphs are flawed in one way or another, I was curious to hear what flaws my test group identified, so that I could have even more insight into creating more engaging visualizations.

### Research Protocol 
A)	Target audience – wide general interest population.  I assume little previous technical knowledge or exposure to finance 
B)	Sampling method – this was a convenience sample and I simply approached a few friends for an informal conversation
C)	Interview script – I administer this less as a formal script and more as a guided conversation.  I let my users go through the deck on their own first and then asked open ended questions like Did you learn anything new? What did you learn? Was the story easy to follow? What confused you? What else did you want to see but didn’t? 
D)	Interview feedback (selected responses)
a.	Slide 1: ‘the statistic is interesting but I don’t know where this is going’  ‘I didn’t love the color scheme initially but in going through the deck it seems to fit the subject matter well’
b.	Slide 2: ‘text is very clear, but graph is muddled’ ‘graph axis aren’t readable, unclear what’s being compared – top 1 vs. bottom 50 of what?’ ‘I don’t like the phrasing of the text, objectively it is widening, subjectively it is worsening.  You should be more objective’
c.	Slide 3: ‘bold subtext is good, but the initial definition seems simplistic’ ‘to be honest, if this were any longer I wouldn’t read it, but as is I feel like I want more information’ 
d.	Slide 4: ‘drop the black subtext and make the graph tell the story for you’ ‘call out text is good but I don’t really understand what I’m looking at in the picture here’ ‘what did you want me to get from the graph? Currently I’m not getting it…’
e.	Slide 5: ‘As before, drop the subtext and tell this visually’ ‘why are you presenting two bar graphs? For simplicity focus on your more expensive story to drive that point home’ ‘you need to do a better job showing the cost of interest vs. the initial purchase cost’
f.	Slide 6: ‘I like this and feel like it builds more off of what came before’ ‘the blue on gray text is hard to read, but I like the use of the call out text in orange’ 
g.	Slide 7: ‘Show me, don’t tell me this’ ‘How do you know? What data is this based on?’ ‘Give me a picture here showing where we are and where we are going’ 
h.	Slide 8: ‘What the hell is in that table and what did you want me to get from it’ ‘I took an econ class years ago and we spend a few weeks on the banking system – I don’t remember any of it, but I don’t think you can teach this in just one slide’ ‘this slide takes away from your story, you got me on interest good and bad, but now you’re wonking out over banking regs, it might be interesting, but it doesn’t go here’ 
i.	Slide 9: ‘Your wording here is muddled’ ‘So that’s what that table was about…’ ‘try to show this visually to explain the fundamental flaw at play here’ 
j.	Slide 10: ‘include background images to better humanize this, as is your deck feels very sterile and clinical’ ‘make this more declarative and lead with your recommendation’ 
k.	Slide 11: ‘show me this, don’t tell me this’ ‘Make this visual so I can see what if any difference this will make’ ‘What do you mean by some amount, you’ve been scaffolding a story and seem to punt on the last rung, why?’
l.	Slide 12: ‘I like that I can do something about this, but do you really think Grandma is going to call her senator about interest rate caps?’ ‘I’m not a US citizen and don’t vote here, I wouldn’t go to a legislator, but is there an option for me to learn more or share with a friend?’ 
E)	Changes implemented
a.	Slide 1 –  Reframed as a rhetorical – why can’t 40% of Americans afford an unexpected expense to give more direction  
b.	Slide 2 – changed subtext to inequality is widening.  Redesigned graphic as a stacked bar, showing the declining share of wealth for the bottom 50% of Americans over time 
c.	Slide 3 – reworked definition text to give more data but still be brief
d.	Slide 4 –  dropped subtext and redesigned graph to show only two use cases of interest and let the title tell the story, ‘starting later, and saving more, still unable to catch up; 
e.	Slide 5 – dropped subtext and redesigned as a divided area chart to show how interest can often far surpass the original principal amount 
f.	Slide 6 – reformatted last clause to highlight the lack of an interest rate cap 
g.	Slide 7 – pulled more data in and plotted and extrapolated a trend line showing a widening divide between haves and have nots 
h.	Slide 8 – Removed 
i.	Slide 9 – Tweaked to build off of new graph in slide 7 – explained there is not enough money to go around
j.	Slide 10 – added stock imagery to better humanize this foreclosed homes, homeless beggars, etc.  Changed text to ‘This problem can be fixed’ to be more declarative 
k.	Slide 11 –  added side by side graph showing the difference in debt levels between capped and uncapped rates.  Matched legislation recco of 15% rate
l.	Slide 12 – provided links to share story as well as links to learn more.

All told the user research process was informative and provided valuable insight into how to strengthen and improve the narrative.  In discussion this in class tonight, I learned even more ideas into how I can tighten this up more and better keep the focus on the story.  As I make the final tweaks to my visualizations I will be sure to solicit outside feedback to ensure that they are as strong as possible.
