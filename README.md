# About Me
Hi all, I’m Matt.  I am in my second year at Heinz studying Public Policy and Data Analytics.  I’m fascinated by the intersection of data and policy and have done a lot of work to leverage data driven decision making to allow communities and organizations to accomplish more.  My recent experience has exposed me to multiple sectors (NGO – disaster relief work, local government - economic development, Federal government – telecommunications policy).  In each role I have seen firsthand how the right data, in the right hands at the right time can have tremendous impact on policy, operational decisions, and ultimately outcomes.  Conversely, I’ve seen how flawed or missing data can lead to suboptimal outcomes.  Post Heinz I hope to pursue a career applying my quantitative skills to furthering the public good.   

# What I hope to learn
I am motivated to take this course to gain additional visualization tools and techniques. I firmly believe that a picture is worth a thousand words.  I have seen firsthand just how impactful a good visualization can be in transforming dense data into a compelling narrative that inspires action.  Having done previous work in GIS and Tableau, I am hoping to learn additional methods and techniques.  Furthermore, I hope to continue to gain a better appreciation for and awareness of design techniques and considerations that I can use to produce even more compelling visuals.  Here’s looking forward to a great semester!
